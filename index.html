<p>Saquon Barkley was taken with the second overall pick by the New York Giants in the 2018 NFL draft. Despite Barkley being the consensus number one overall prospect, it is widely looked at as being one of the biggest draft blunders in recent memory. Dave Gettleman was the Giants’ General Manager at the time. Gettleman has gone down at having one of the worst tenures a GM has ever had and taking Barkley sums up his time running the show. Decades ago, taking a running back in the top 10 wouldn’t stand out, but a lot has changed with how teams construct their rosters in order to keep up with the times. When the NFL first started in the 1920s, teams won by pounding the rock. The forward pass was still a fairly new phenomenon. Quarterbacks had a very limited role. Starting in the 1940s-50s, we started to see a change in offensive philosophy. Teams came around on the value of a lethal passing attack and the efficiency that passing brought to the game. A couple decades later, we finally saw passing and rushing output start to drift farther and farther apart. Still, people around the league shared the same values of what the game of football was built on. Teams had to run the ball and stop the run. Running backs were still seen as a very valuable position. If a team was going to have success, they had to be able to establish the run in order to set up their explosive passing attack. Fast forward to the 21st century and entire viewpoints have changed. Anyone who points to the value of the running back or says one has to run in order to set up the pass is labeled a dinosaur and is laughed at, Gettleman included. “Teams have evolved their opinion on how to win,” Dan Schneier, host of a New York Giants podcast and editor for CBS Sports, said. Looking at the 2022 season and the average number of passing and rushing yards per team, there was about a 1,700-yard difference between the two offensive plans of attack. A difference that seems to be increasing with each passing season.

  <div class="passing">
  <p> The difference in offensive philosophy has not only changed how the game is played on the field, but it has had a profound effect on how teams construct their rosters in the offseason. “This offseason, [the Cleveland Browns] are really going away from what they built their identity on as a run-first team under Kevin Stefanski. They made an investment with the Eli Moore trade [a wide receiver previously with the Jets], they drafted Cedric Tillman early [a receiver out of Tennessee]. They are going to become one of the most pass-happy teams [in the league]” Schneier said. There is no event bigger than the NFL draft. The draft is the best (and most cost-effective) way to improve your team. No team drafts for need and always should take the best player available, but there are some exceptions to the rule. A hot button topic every draft season is positional value. It’s obvious some positions are more valuable than others. The position that leads these discussions is the running back spot. Looking at recent examples like Le’Veon Bell, Todd Gurley, Ezekiel Elliott and DeMarco Murray, the RB position is one that suffers a lot of injuries and tends to have a much shorter career life span. When spending premium assets, one wants to be sure they are spending it in a way that will have a long-lasting impact, but the league has already seen teams take a buyer’s beware approach at running back. “Running backs with a lot of talent are falling to the second round. Jonathan Tyalor had a really good profile coming into the draft, ran a 4.39 [40-yard dash], great size, speed back…with a crazy amount of college production…and he fell into the second round,” Schneier said. Teams draft for the future. The draft is an opportunity to get cost-effective starters at positions that have become incredibly expensive on the free agent market. Rookies play on relatively cheap contracts compared to top performers at their respective position. “Another [draft strategy] is stressing the importance of drafting premium positions,” Schneier said. Aside from quarterback, wide receiver is one of the most valuable positions when it comes to affecting the pass. Due to this, the wide receiver market has skyrocketed in recent years. In response, the NFL saw six receivers selected in the first 18 picks of the 2022 draft. Meanwhile, the NFL has witnessed six RBs taken in the first round in the last five drafts combined. Teams still will use draft capital on running backs later in the draft, but receivers have still overtaken the position both early and often. “You’re going to see the NFL really put a stress on the arms race…where [we’ll have] an insane number of wide receivers go in rounds one through three, [even] for guys who were projected to go in rounds five, six [and] seven,” Schneier said.

<div class="draft">
  <p> Leading up the 2023 draft, the NFL world was experiencing a similar scenario to the one in 2018. Bijan Robinson, a running back out of Texas, was arguably the best prospect in the entire class, but there was a ton of debate about where he should end up going. The Atlanta Falcons pulled the trigger with the eighth overall pick. Picking in the top 10 typically means those teams have a boatload of needs, and the Falcons were one of those organizations. Robinson will be a great player, but was that high pick well spent? Would Atlanta have gotten more return on their investment if they had selected a position that directly affects the passing game either on offense or defense? Running back has also become a deep position, one where teams can find value throughout all seven rounds. “[2023 had] an insanely strong running back class, so in rounds two through four, there was value all [over the board],” Schneier said. Five years removed from taking Barkley second overall, the Giants are their on third head coach, their previous GM was fired and most of their front office has been wiped out. Barkley has already suffered numerous injuries that have slowed his production and also his burst, which is what made him a unique talent to begin with. Drafting Barkley set the Giants back years in their rebuild. With how the NFL has been trending, teams are using their premium resources on positions that can either enhance its passing attack on offense or on defensive playmakers that can suffocate explosive passing schemes. From how the game is played to shorter careers, it’s become clearer and clearer that using top assets on ball-carriers is money (or draft capital) not well spent. As the old saying goes: adapt or die.
